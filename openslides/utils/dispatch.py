class SignalConnectMetaClass(type):
    """
    Metaclass to connect the children of a base class to a Django signal.

    Classes must have a signal argument and a get_dispatch_uid classmethod.
    The signal argument must be the Django signal the class should be
    connected to. The get_dispatch_uid classmethod must return a unique
    value for each child class and None for base classes which will not be
    connected.

    The classmethod get_all_objects is added as get_all classmethod to every
    class using this metaclass. Calling this on a base class or on child
    classes will retrieve all connected children, on instance for each child
    class.

    These instances will have a check_permission method which returns True
    by default. You can override this method to return False on runtime if
    you want to filter some children.

    They will also have a get_default_weight method which returns the value
    of the default_weight attribute which is 0 by default. You can override
    the attribute or the method to sort the children.

    Example:

    class Base(object):
        __metaclass__ = SignalConnectMetaClass
        signal = django.dispatch.Signal()
        @classmethod
        def get_dispatch_uid(cls):
            if not cls.__name__ == 'Base':
                return cls.__name__

    class Child(Base):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            pass

    child = Base.get_all(request)[0]
    assert Child == type(child)
