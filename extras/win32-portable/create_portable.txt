How to create a new portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Follow the OpenSlides installation instructions for windows,
    but add the option "-Z" when executing easy_install, e.g.:

      easy_install -Z django django-mptt reportlab pil

2.) Install OpenSlides by running python setup.py install in the top directory
    of OpenSlides.
    NOTE: This step must be repeated whenever you make changes to OpenSlides

3.) In the main directory of the OpenSlides checkout execute:

      python extras/win32-portable/prepare_portable.py

4.) The portable OpenSlides distribution is now ready as a zip in the
    'dist/' directory

Note: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible,
if Python is installed in 64-bit version.
