How to create a new portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Follow the OpenSlides installation instructions for windows,
    but add the option "-Z" when executing easy_install, e.g.:

      easy_install -Z django django-mptt beautifulsoup4 bleach pillow qrcode reportlab tornado

2.) To update the version resource of the prebuild openslides.exe
    pywin32 should be installed (it is not strictly required but at
    least for releases that are to be published it is highly advisable)

    To install it just grab the binary installer from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe/download

3.) Run in the main directory of the OpenSlides checkout:

      python extras\win32-portable\prepare_portable.py

4.) The portable OpenSlides distribution is now ready as a zip archive
    in the 'dist' directory


NOTE: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible
if Python is installed in 64-bit(!) version.
