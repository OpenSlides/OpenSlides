How to create a new portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Follow the OpenSlides installation instructions for windows,
    but add the option "-Z" when executing easy_install, e.g.:

      easy_install -Z django django-mptt reportlab pil

2.) Install OpenSlides by running in the top directory:

        python setup.py install

    NOTE: This step must be repeated whenever you make changes to OpenSlides.

3.) Run in the main directory of the OpenSlides checkout:

      python extras\win32-portable\prepare_portable.py

4.) The portable OpenSlides distribution is now ready as a zip archive 
    in the 'dist' directory


NOTE: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible,
if Python is installed in 64-bit version.
