# OpenSlides 3 Client

Prototype application for OpenSlides 3.0 (Client).
Currently under constant heavy maintenance.

## Development Info

As an Angular project, Angular CLI is highly recommended to create components and services.
See https://angular.io/guide/quickstart for details.

### Contribution Info

Please respect the code-style defined in `.editorconf` and `.pretierrc`.

Code alignment should be automatically corrected by the pre-commit hooks.
Adjust your editor to the `.editorconfig` to avoid surprises.
See https://editorconfig.org/ for details.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Before commiting, new code will automatically be aligned to the definitions set in the
`.prettierrc`.
Furthermore, new code has to pass linting.

Our pre-commit hooks are:
`pretty-quick --staged` and `lint`
See `package.json` for details.

### Documentation Info

The documentation can be generated by running `npm run compodoc`.
A new web server will be started on http://localhost:8080
Once running, the documentation will be updated automatically.

Please document new code using JSDoc tags.
See https://compodoc.app/guides/jsdoc-tags.html for details.

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

A running OpenSlides (2.2 or higher) instance is expected on port 8000.

Start OpenSlides as usual using
`python manage.py start --no-browser --host 0.0.0.0`
