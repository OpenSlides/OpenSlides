## Patchnotes 4.2.18

### New Features
- Live voting: During nominal votes in motions, single votes can be projected while voting is in progress, so that it is possible to see live who voted how. The votes are grouped by structure level. In the settings, there is the option to set this as the default for nominal votes. When voting is stopped, the result can be anonymized immediately.

### Optimizations
- Accounts: You can search by home committee and external.
- Autopilot: When a list of speakers is projected, the list of speakers is displayed in addition to the projector and can be managed in the Autopilot.
- Motions > Forwarding: While backtracking, you can see from which meeting and in what status amendments were forwarded.
- Participants: Home committee and external members are listed under organization specific information.
- Participants > Export: In the example file, home committee and external members are now listed after the SAML ID.
- Search in lists: Ctrl+F now opens the search field of the current list.
- Improved key assignment for control on macOS.
- Added various translations.

### Bug Fixes
- Committees: When switching between parent and child committees, the search for committees is cleared.
- Committees > External: The designation for external is now consistent throughout.
- Motions > Amendments: New amendments are now always displayed immediately.
- Motions > Change recommendations: If change recommendations refer to deleted lines, it is now possible to delete them.
- Motions > Categories: Within a category, motions can be sorted using multi selection.
- Motions > Export: The preselection provides the correct specifications, especially with regard to line numbers and unavailable options.
