IV.  Installation on Windows using the Python Package Index (PyPI)
==================================================================

NOTE: There is a portable version of OpenSlides for Windows which does not
required any install steps! If there is a reason that you can not use the
portable version you should run the following install steps.

  1. Install requirements:

        The OpenSlides install requires following programs, which should be
        installed first:
          + Python Programming Language 2 (>= 2.6)
          + Setuptools

     a) Download and run 32-bit MSI installer from http://www.python.org/:

        http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5.msi

        Note that the 32-bit MSI installer is required even on a 64-bit
        Windows system. If you use the 64-bit MSI installer, step 3 of this
        instruction will fail unless you installed the packages reportlab
        and pillow manually.

     b) Add python dirs to PATH (via Control Panel > System > Advanced):

        ";C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts"

        Note that the path can differ if you customized the install of
        Python in step a).

     c) Download the install script ez_setup.py for Setuptools 0.7.7 from
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.7.7#windows and run (via
        double click).

  2. Setup a virtual environment with Virtual Python Environment builder (optional):

        You can setup a virtual environment to install OpenSlides as
        non-root user.

        To install Virtual Python Environment builder, open command line
        (cmd) and run:

        > easy_install https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.9.1.tar.gz

        To setup and activate the virtual environment, create your
        OpenSlides directory, open command line (cmd), change to the
        directory and run:

        > virtualenv .venv
        > .venv\Scripts\activate

  3. Install OpenSlides:

        Run on command line (cmd):

        > easy_install openslides
