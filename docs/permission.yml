# To get a permission string you have to combine the top level string
# with one of the strings in the lower levels. Permissions are e. g.
# agenda_item.can_manage or agenda_item.can_see.

# The permissions are hierarchical. Users with agenda_item.can_manage do have
# implicitly agenda_item.can_see_internal and agenda_item.can_see.
