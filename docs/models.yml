# Types:
#     - Nativ datatypes: string, number, boolean, JSON
#     - HTMLStrict: A string with HTML content.
#     - HTMLPermissive: A string with HTML content (with video tags).
#     - float: Numbers that are expected to be non-integer. Formatted as in rfc7159.
#     - decimal(X): Decimal values represented as a string with X decimal places.
#       At the moment we support only X == 6.
#     - timestamp: Datetime as a unix timestamp. Why a number? This enables queries
#       in the DB. And we do not need more precision than 1 second.
#     - <T>[]: This indicates and arbitrary array of the given type. At the moment
#       we support only some types. You can add JSON Schema properties for items
#       using the extra property `items`
#     - color: string that must match ^#[0-9a-f]{6}$
# Relations:
#     - We have the following types: `relation`, `relation-list`, `generic-relation`
#       and `generic-relation-list`.
#     - Non-generic relations: The simple syntax for such a field
#       `to: <collection>/<field>`. This is a reference to a collection. The reverse
#       relation field in this collection is <field>. E. g. in a motion the field
#       `category_id` links to one category where the field `motion_ids` contains the
#       motion id. The simple notation for the field is `motion_category/motion_ids`.
#       The reverse field has type `relation-list` and is related back to
#       `motion/category_id`. The type indicates that there are many
#       motion ids.
#     - Generic relations: The difference to non-generic relations is that you have a
#       list of possible fields, so `to` can either hold multiple collections (if the
#       field name is the same):
#         to:
#           collections:
#             - agenda_item
#             - assignment
#             - ...
#           field: tag_ids
#       Or `to` can be a list of collection fields:
#         to:
#           - motion/option_ids
#           - user/option_$_ids
#     - on_delete: This fields determines what should happen with the foreign model if
#       this model gets deleted. Possible values are:
#           - SET_NULL (default): delete the id from the foreign key
#           - PROTECT: if the foreign key is not empty, throw an error instead of
#                      deleting the object
#           - CASCADE: also delete all models in this foreign key
# Structured fields:
#     - There are template fields (see autoupdate service interface) with a `$` as
#       the placeholder.
#     - The type `template` describes a structured field for the given model. If the
#       property `replacement_collection` is given, it describes which model the
#       replacement ids are belonging to (=> structured relation). If it is not given,
#       the field is a structured tag. The property `fields` contains the definition
#       for all the fields that come from the template field.
# JSON Schema Properties:
#     - You can add JSON Schema properties to the fields like `enum`, `description`,
#       `maxLength` and `minimum`
# Additional properties:
#     - The property `read_only` describes a field that can not be changed by an action.
#     - The property `default` describes the default value that is used for new objects.
#     - The property `required` describes that this field can not be null or an empty
#       string. If this field is given it must have some content.
#     - The property `equal_fields` describes fields that must have the same value in
#       the instance and the related instance.

# A projection is a M2M model between an element that is assigned to a
# projector. This element can either be the current one projected, in the
# preview, or in the history, but not more than one once. A projection is
# projector-specific, meaning that once a projection is created for a projector
# and element, these references will not change.
